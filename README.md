# Diabetes-LDA
This project looks in depth at LDA. We use a dataset on diabetes from the CDC. Blah blah blah

# LDA.py
Linear Discriminant Analysis

Implements Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction and classification. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with scatter matrices computed to capture within-class and between-class variance. Using eigen decomposition, the data is projected into a lower-dimensional space for visualization and analysis. A custom classifier predicts classes based on proximity to class means in the reduced space.

# LDA_RF.py
LDA with Random Forest Classifier

Combines Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction with a Random Forest Classifier for diabetes classification. The LDA transformation projects the data onto lower dimensions, with varying numbers of eigenvectors tested for classification performance.

# LDA_Grid_Search.py
Implements stuff yes

# rf.py
do we need this..?

# all_implementation.py
